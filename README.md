packer-testing
==============

Packer is a tool for building VM images. See http://www.packer.io/

Install:
Download from http://www.packer.io/downloads.html
Extract files to %imwops_tools$\HashiCorp\Vagrant

Testing with example.json from the Packer online docs.
Expanding to a Rackspace provider
Downloaded http://developer.rackspace.com/blog/powerclient-rackspace-cloud-api-powershell-client.html to help get image ids.
packer v0.6.0 seems to be broken with respect to Rackspace cloud. v0.5.2 seems OK, but doesn't support api keys.
